# Face Recognition System

This project implements a face recognition system using MTCNN and FaceNet.
It detects faces from images or video and generates facial embeddings.
TensorFlow and OpenCV are used for deep learning and image processing.
Generated embeddings can be stored and compared for recognition.
The project is written in Python and is easy to extend.
Install dependencies using requirements.txt before running.
Execute the main script to start face detection and recognition.
This project is intended for educational purposes only.
