🎯 Mutual Fund Price Prediction Model

This type of project demonstrates everything employers want to see in a strong AI/DL intern candidate:

🔍 What it shows ✅ Why it's impressive
Domain knowledge Finance is a hot domain (FinTech)
Real-world data handling Shows practical skills with messy, non-toy data
Deep learning + time series Uses LSTM/GRU to learn sequential patterns in financial data
Data pipelines You can collect, clean, and use 5 years of historical NAV data
Model explainability & performance Attention mechanism or feature analysis shows understanding of model decisions
Bonus (deployment) Deploying a web app demonstrates end-to-end skills

✅ Yes — But Build It the Right Way

A “top-tier” project isn’t just about the idea — it’s about execution and presentation.

🧩 Suggested Project Structure — Deep Learning NAV Predictor

📁 1. Problem Statement
Predict next-day NAV of a mutual fund using past 30–60 days of data and market indicators
Optional: classify as "buy", "hold", "sell"

📥 2. Data Collection
Source: AMFI India, Yahoo Finance, yfinance library
Pull 5 years of historical NAVs and market indicators (e.g., NIFTY, interest rates, inflation)

🧹 3. Data Cleaning + Feature Engineering
Remove missing data
Create lag features, rolling averages, momentum, volatility
Add macroeconomic indicators as features

📊 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Plot NAV trends over time
Correlation heatmaps
Visualize how indicators influence price

🤖 5. Modeling
Build advanced deep learning models:
✅ Stacked LSTM / GRU
✅ Optional attention mechanism to focus on key time steps
Train/test split + early stopping to prevent overfitting

📈 6. Evaluation
Use metrics like RMSE, MAPE
Visual comparison of predicted vs actual NAV
Analyze attention weights or feature importance

🌐 7. Optional Deployment
Use Flask, Streamlit, or Gradio to create a web app
Host on AWS EC2 (live demo)
Optional: fetch live prices via API

📝 8. Documentation
Clean GitHub repo
